## Question 1: Data Types and Date Handling

### Data Type of Dates
The `actualShipDate` column is a `datetime64[ns]` type - a specialized format that treats each value as a proper calendar date with time information. You can check this using the `.dtype` attribute on any pandas Series.

### Why Same Types Matter
Think of it like sorting apples and oranges:

::: {.callout-note}
If one date is text ("2025-04-11") and another is a real date object:

- The computer won't understand they're dates
- It can't calculate time differences
- It can't properly compare which came first
:::

## Question 2: String vs Date Comparison

::: {.callout-important}
## The Problem with String Dates

When comparing "04-11-2025" and "05-20-2024" as strings:

- The computer looks at characters from left to right
- It sees "04" < "05", so thinks April 2025 comes before May 2024
- This is wrong! 2025 should come after 2024
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Real-World Analogy
It's like sorting phone numbers as text:
- As text: "2" comes after "11" (wrong!)
- As numbers: 2 comes before 11 (correct!)

Same with dates - they need to be proper date objects for correct ordering.

### Summary
- Always use proper date types for dates
- Convert strings to dates before comparing
- Let the computer understand these are calendar dates, not just text
