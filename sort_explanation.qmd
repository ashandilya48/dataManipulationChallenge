## Question 1: Sorting Strategies

::: {.callout-note}
## ascending=True vs False
Think of it like organizing books on a shelf:

- `ascending=True`: A→Z, 1→9 (smallest first)
- `ascending=False`: Z→A, 9→1 (largest first)

In our shipping data:
- `ascending=True`: Show on-time shipments first
- `ascending=False`: Show most delayed shipments first

## Sorting by Multiple Columns
Use a list of columns and a list of directions:

```python
df.sort_values(
    by=['is_late', 'days_late'],
    ascending=[True, False]
)
```

Like sorting a library:
1. First by section (is_late)
2. Then by publication date (days_late)

## Question 2: Index Management

::: {.callout-important}
## Why Reset Index?
The original index is like sticky notes on your data:

- When you sort, the sticky notes stay with their original rows
- This breaks the visual "1,2,3..." sequence
- `.reset_index(drop=True)` gives you fresh, sequential numbers
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Problems with Original Index
Without resetting:
- Row 5 might appear before Row 1
- Position ≠ Index number
- Hard to reference "first N rows"

Example from shipping data:
```
Index  days_late
  20      5
   3      4
  15      3
```
Confusing! Are we looking at row 1, 2, or 3?

## Best Practice
Always `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting if you want:
- Clean, sequential numbering
- Easy slicing with `.head()` or `.tail()`
- Clear relationship between position and index
